## 🎯 What This Add-in Does

### Core Features

✅ **Instant Folder Search** - Fuzzy search through all your email folders  
✅ **Keyboard Driven** - Navigate with arrows, move with Enter  
✅ **Recent Folders** - Quick access to your most-used folders  
✅ **Fast UX** - Optimistic UI makes operations feel instant  
✅ **Smart Caching** - Folders cached for 6 hours for speed  
✅ **Auto-Close** - Taskpane closes after successful move  
✅ **Notifications** - Native Outlook banners confirm actions  
✅ **Cross-Platform** - Works in Desktop & Web versions  

### Why It's Fast

Even though Microsoft Graph API takes 500-1500ms to move emails, the add-in feels instant because:

1. **Token Prefetch** - Auth happens when taskpane opens (~200ms saved)
2. **Folder Cache** - Folders load instantly from localStorage
3. **Optimistic UI** - Shows "success" immediately (50ms)
4. **Progressive Feedback** - Status → Notification → Auto-close
5. **Background API** - Graph call happens while UI updates

**User sees confirmation in 150ms, taskpane closes at 300ms** ⚡

## 💡 Common Questions

### Where are the icons?

**You need to generate them first!**
1. Open `src/assets/icon-generator.html`
2. Click "Download All"
3. Save to `src/assets/`

### Can I use this in production?

**Yes**, but you need to:
1. Host files on an HTTPS server (required for production)
2. Update all `localhost:3000` URLs in `manifest.xml`
3. Deploy via Microsoft 365 Admin Center or share manifest

See [INSTALLATION.md](./INSTALLATION.md) → Production Deployment

### How do I customize it?

**Common customizations:**
- **Change colors**: Edit Tailwind classes in `taskpane.html`
- **Adjust cache time**: Change `CONFIG.CACHE_TTL` in `taskpane.js`
- **More recent folders**: Change `CONFIG.RECENT_LIMIT` in `taskpane.js`
- **Fuzzy search sensitivity**: Adjust `CONFIG.FUSE_THRESHOLD` in `taskpane.js`

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for development guide

### Something's not working?

1. **Check setup**: http://localhost:3000/setup-check.html
2. **Verify server is running**: `npm start` should be active
3. **Check browser console**: Press F12 in taskpane, look for errors
4. **See troubleshooting**: [INSTALLATION.md](./INSTALLATION.md) → Troubleshooting

### Can I use this without npm/Node.js?

**Yes**, but you need to:
1. Use any web server (Python's `http.server`, VS Code Live Server, etc.)
2. Update `manifest.xml` with your server's URL and port
3. Ensure CORS is enabled for development
